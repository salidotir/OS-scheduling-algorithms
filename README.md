# OS-scheduling-algorithms
OS scheduling algorithms including IO

* Four operating system algorithm for scheduling tasks is implemented in python:
1. FCFS
2. Round Robin
3. SRT
4. SJF

Input is read from a '.csv' file ith format below:
p-id, arrival-time, cpu-burst-1, io-time, cpu-burst-2

Output is 4 '.jpg' files that shows the gantt chart for each of algorithms.
